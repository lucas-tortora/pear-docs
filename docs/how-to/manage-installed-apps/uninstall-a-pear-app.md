# Uninstall a Pear Application

Uninstalling Pear Applications is currently not supported. You can reset the storage for an application via the `pear reset <link>` command. This is a **destructive** command that will permanently delete the storage for the application loosing all data it contains. Use with caution.

For more information about the `pear reset` command, see the [cli docs](./cli.md#pear-reset-flags-less-than-link-greater-than).
